    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Solar System Explorer. This is a placeholder for our Privacy Policy. We take your privacy seriously.</p>
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We only collect the minimum amount of data necessary to run the service, specifically your **TON Wallet Address** and on-chain transaction history. We do not store private keys.</p>
    <h2>Wallet Connection</h2>
    <p>Connecting your TON wallet grants us read-only access to your public address and balances as required by the TON Connect protocol. This data is used solely for game functionality (tracking your STAR tokens, NFTs, and referral stats).</p>
    <p>The full legal policy will be published here soon, explaining data retention, user rights, and compliance.</p>
