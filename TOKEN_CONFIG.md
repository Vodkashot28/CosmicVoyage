### Economic Philosophy

#### Early Game (Discovery Phase)
- Abundant STAR rewards for onboarding new players
- Low burn costs to encourage utility experimentation
- Focus: Education and collection initiation

#### Mid Game (Advancement Phase)
- Balanced earning vs. burning (utilities, cosmetics)
- Passive income from NFT ownership accelerates
- Focus: Strategic token allocation and utility selection

#### Late Game (Mastery Phase)
- Scarcity-driven trading and governance participation
- Prestige crafting with rare cosmetic rewards
- DAO governance and treasury control
- Focus: Long-term value and community leadership
