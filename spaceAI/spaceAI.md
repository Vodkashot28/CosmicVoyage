# SpaceAI 🌌

**Educational AI system for celestial classification and orbital prediction**

SpaceAI is a machine learning bridge between astronomy education and interactive game integration. It provides tools to classify celestial objects and predict orbital behavior using real astronomical data.

## 📁 Structure

- **data/** — Datasets of celestial parameters (orbital period, axial tilt, mass, radius)
- **models/** — Trained AI models for classification and prediction (.pkl, .h5)
- **notebooks/** — Experimental training notebooks for building and testing models
- **src/** — Integration scripts that connect trained models to the main Cosmic Voyage game

## 🧬 Purpose

SpaceAI serves as:
- A **learning tool** for understanding machine learning applied to astronomy
- A **knowledge engine** that classifies celestial objects and predicts orbital behavior
- A **bridge** between training experiments and interactive game integration

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install dependencies: `poetry install`
2. Explore datasets in `data/`
3. Train models in `notebooks/` using Jupyter
4. Save trained models to `models/`
5. Use models in `src/` for game integration

## 📚 Educational Focus

- Understand supervised learning (classification)
- Apply scikit-learn to real astronomical data
- Visualize celestial object patterns with matplotlib
- Bridge theoretical ML and practical gaming applications

## 🔗 Integration

Models trained here power educational features in the main Cosmic Voyage game:
- Celestial object classification
- Orbital parameter prediction
- Discovery recommendations
- Educational quizzes based on ML insights
