# Planet NFT Rarity System

## Rarity Tiers (Updated)

The rarity system is based on **difficulty of acquisition** - how hard it is to reach each planet.

### Common (Mercury) - 🟢
- **Discovery Order**: 1st planet
- **Rarity**: Common
- **Reason**: Everyone gets Mercury first - easiest to discover
- **Abundance**: Very common, all players have this

### Rare (Venus, Earth) - 🔵
- **Discovery Order**: 2nd-3rd planets
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Reason**: Most players will get these early
- **Abundance**: Moderately common

### Epic (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) - 🟣
- **Discovery Order**: 4th-6th planets
- **Rarity**: Epic
- **Reason**: Takes more progression to reach
- **Abundance**: Uncommon - dedicated players only

### Legendary (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) - 🟡
- **Discovery Order**: 7th-8th planets
- **Rarity**: Legendary
- **Reason**: Very hard to reach - requires full commitment
- **Abundance**: Extremely rare - hardcore players only

## Why This Makes Sense

- **Mercury** (1st): Easy, accessible, common rarity ✅
- **Neptune** (8th): Hard, requires dedication, legendary rarity ✅
- **Prestige**: Players feel accomplished when reaching legendary planets
- **Scarcity**: Late-game NFTs are rarer and more valuable
- **Economy**: Legendary NFTs worth more in trades
