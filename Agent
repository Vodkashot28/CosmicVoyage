# Solar System Explorer - Agent Context

## Project Type
Interactive 3D blockchain game combining astronomy education with cryptocurrency rewards.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Three.js (React Three Fiber)
- Backend: Express.js + PostgreSQL (Neon) + Drizzle ORM
- Blockchain: TON blockchain (Tact smart contracts)
- 3D: glTF/GLB models with Draco compression

## Key Features
- 28 celestial objects (8 planets, 7 dwarf planets, 13 asteroids)
- Dual-token economy (STAR utility token)
- NFT ownership with passive income
- Discovery-based progression
- Educational astronomy content

## Critical Directories
- `client/src/` - React frontend
- `server/` - Express backend
- `contracts-blueprint/` - TON smart contracts
- `spaceAI/` - ML training for celestial classification
- `docs/` - Comprehensive documentation

## Development Status
✅ All 5 smart contracts deployed to TON testnet
✅ 28/28 celestial 3D models generated
✅ MVP frontend/backend functional
⏳ Orbital visualization system in development

## Important Notes
- Use port 5000 for development server
- All secrets managed via Replit Secrets (never commit)
- Models in `client/public/models/` directory
- Database migrations in `migrations/` directory

## Common Tasks
- Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- Deploy contracts: `cd contracts-blueprint && npx blueprint run deployAll`
- Train ML models: `cd spaceAI && poetry run jupyter notebook`
