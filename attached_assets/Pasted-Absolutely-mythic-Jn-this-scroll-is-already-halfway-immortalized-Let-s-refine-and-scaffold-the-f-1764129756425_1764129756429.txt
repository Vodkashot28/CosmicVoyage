Absolutely mythic, Jn — this scroll is already halfway immortalized. Let’s refine and scaffold the final touches so future restorationists can follow your planetary ritual with clarity and precision.

🌌 Restorationist Scroll: Solar System .glb Generation (Finalized Edition)

🔧 Step 1: Generate Each Planet as .glb

Use Meshy.ai — supports text-to-3D and image-to-3D, with .glb export.

🪐 Prompts for Meshy (Text-to-3D)

| Planet   | Prompt |
|----------|--------|
| Sun      | “Glowing stylized Sun sphere with emissive texture, low-poly, .glb export” |
| Earth    | “Stylized Earth with vivid oceans and continents, cloud layer, low-poly, .glb export” |
| Mars     | “Stylized Mars with red rocky surface, craters, low-poly, .glb export” |
| Jupiter  | “Stylized Jupiter with gas bands and Great Red Spot, low-poly, .glb export” |
| Saturn   | “Stylized Saturn with thin transparent rings, low-poly, .glb export” |
| Uranus   | “Stylized Uranus with pale blue color, low-poly, .glb export” |
| Neptune  | “Stylized Neptune with deep blue texture, low-poly, .glb export” |
| Venus    | “Stylized Venus with cloudy yellow surface, low-poly, .glb export” |

> 💡 Tip: Upload your solar system screenshot for image-to-3D generation if you want Meshy to match your visual style.

🌀 Step 2: Add Orbits and Rings

- Saturn’s Rings: If Meshy omits them, generate a separate ring mesh or add in Blender using a torus + alpha texture.
- Orbits: Use thin torus meshes or circle paths. In Three.js, you can use THREE.RingGeometry or THREE.LineLoop.

🧩 Step 3: Assemble the Scene

- Import .glb files into:
  - Blender (for layout and export)
  - Three.js (for web interactivity)
  - Babylon.js (for game engine integration)
- Position planets along stylized orbits (not to scale).
- Add starfield background using HDRI or procedural skybox.
- Export final scene as .glb or keep planets modular for dynamic loading.

🪐 Bonus: Interactive Web Viewer (Three.js Ritual)

Use Three.js with GLTFLoader to load .glb planets.

🔁 Features to Scaffold:
- Rotation: planet.rotation.y += 0.01
- Zoom: OrbitControls with enableZoom: true
- Click-to-info: raycaster + onClick → show modal or tooltip with planet lore
