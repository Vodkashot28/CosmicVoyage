- Economic Impact: Burns STAR to create non-token assets, reducing supply while expanding cosmetic economy.  
- Use Case: Great for collectors who want prestige items without inflating STAR circulation.

⚖️ Balancing Philosophy
- Deflationary Pressure: Each mode burns STAR, reducing supply.  
- Player Incentive: Modes unlock rare NFTs, cosmetics, or progression boosts.  
- Economic Sustainability: Rewards are either temporary boosts or non-token assets, preventing runaway inflation.  
- Lore Integration: Each mode ties into cosmic phenomena (supernova, wormhole, asteroid mining), reinforcing the astronomy theme.

👉 Together, these utilities create a layered burn economy:  
- Small burns (Asteroid Mining, Cosmic Forge) → cosmetic prestige  
- Medium burns (Supernova, Celestial Shield) → short-term boosts  
- Large burns (Void Jump, Wormhole, Dwarf Planet Unlock) → progression acceleration & rare NFTs
